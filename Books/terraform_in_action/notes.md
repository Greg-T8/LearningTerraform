## Part 1: Terraform Bootcamp

### Chapter 1: Getting Started with Terraform

#### 1.2 Hello Terraform Example

**Scenario**: Use Terraform to deploy a virtual machine (EC2 instance) on AWS.

<img src="./images/20250421-ch01-terraform-hello-overview.svg" width="700"/>

The sequence of steps to deploy the EC2 instance using Terraform:

<img src="./images/20250421-ch01-terraform-hello-sequence.svg" alt="Sequence diagram showing the steps to deploy an EC2 instance using Terraform" width="600"/>

##### 1.2.1 Writing the Configuration

The HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)  is used to declare an aws_instance resource in a Terraform configuration file. The configuration file is a text file with a `.tf` extension. The file contains the following code:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "helloworld" {
  ami           = "ami-09dd2e08d601bff67"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```
The first line declares a resource and exactly two labels, the first is the type of resource (aws_instance) and the second is a name for the resource (helloworld). Together the type and name form a unique identifier for the resource.

The remaining lines of the resource block are called arguments.

![Sample inputs and outputs](./images/2025042701-InputsOutputs.svg)

##### 1.2.2 Configuring the AWS Provider

Providers can be either `aws`, `azurerm`, or `google`. 

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "helloworld" {
  ami           = "ami-09dd2e08d601bff67"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```
Things to note:
- Providers only have inputs, no outputs.

##### 1.2.3 Initializing Terraform

Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform and download the AWS provider plugin:

##### 1.2.4 Deploying the EC2 Instance

Run `terraform apply` to create the EC2 instance. Terraform will prompt for confirmation before proceeding with the deployment. After confirming, Terraform will create the EC2 instance and display the output.

After configuring AWS credentials...

Confirm resource creation: 

<img src='images/20250504074915.png' width='650'/>

Information about the created resource is stored in the Terraform state file with the `.tfstate` extension:

<img src='images/20250504075040.png' width='650'/>

> IMPORTANT: Do not manuaually edit or delete the `.tfstate` file. Terraform uses this file to keep track of the resources it manages. If you edit or delete it, Terraform may lose track of the resources and cause issues in future operations.

Use `terraform show` to display the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform. This command will show the details of the EC2 instance created in the previous step.

##### 1.2.5 Destroying the EC2 Instance

Run `terraform destroy` to remove the EC2 instance created in the previous step. 

<img src='images/20250504075742.png' width='550'/>

#### 1.3 Brave new "Hello Terraform"

Terraform can also provision resources dynamically based on the results of external queries and data lookups.

*Data sources* are elements that allow you to fetch data at runtime and perform computations.

In the following example, we pass the output value into `aws_instance` so that we don't have to statically set the AMI in the EC2 instance resource configuration.

![Data Sources](./images/20250504-Data_Sources.svg)

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    profile = "tf-user"
    region = "us-west-2"
}

# Data sources are declared having exactly two labels
# The type, "aws_ami", and name, "ubuntu", must be unique within the module
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
    most_recent = true
    filter {
        name = "name"
        values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]       # Represents the owner of the AMI, in this case, Canonical
}

# Resources are declared having exactly two labels
resource "aws_instance" "helloworld" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags          = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```

Use the following commands to create, show, and destroy the EC2 instance:

```powershell
terraform apply         # Create the EC2 instance
terraform show          # Show the current state of the infrastructure
terraform destroy       # Remove the EC2 instance
```

### Chapter 2: Life Cycle of a Terraform Resource

Fundamentally, Terraform is a state operation tool that performs CRUD operations on managed resources.

Terraform has *local-only resources* that exist only within the confines of Terraform or the machine running Terraform. These resources are not managed by any provider and are not created or destroyed in the cloud. They are used to manage local state and configuration.

Examples include reosurces for creating private keys, self-signed certificates,  and random ids.

#### 2.1 Process Overview

We will use the `local_file` resource from the `Local` provider to create, read, update, and delete a text file.

Here's a look at the workflow:

![Local Provider Workflow](./images/2025050702.svg)

#### 2.1.1 Life cycle function hooks

All Terraform resources implement the resource schema interface. This schema mandates CRUD function hooks, one each for `Create()`, `Read()`, `Update()`, and `Delete()` operations. 

Because it's a resource, `local_file` also implements this interface.
